## Setup Development Environment

First of all, fork Optuna MCP on GitHub. You can learn about fork in the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

$ cd optuna-mcp
$ uv sync   # Install dependencies
$ pwd       # Check the path to your optuna-mcp directory.
/PATH/TO/optuna-mcp
$ which uv  # Check the path to your uv binary.
/PATH/TO/uv
```

After the installation, configure the MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) as explained in the [README.md](README.md#installation).
Please fill the placeholders of path to your uv binary and optuna-mcp directory:

```json

  "mcpServers": {

      "args": [
        "--directory",

        "run",
        "optuna-mcp",
        "--storage",
